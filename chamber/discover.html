                    the Battle
                    of Callao, which had taken place on May 2, 1866. It was built over a previous square known as the
                    Oval of the Queen (Spanish: Óvalo de la Reina), located near the gates of the city, which had since
                    been overrun by urban growth. The square is dominated by a central monument, built in France and
                    reassembled in Peru between 1873 and 1874, allowing the square to be inaugurated in July 1874. The
                    architect was Edmond Guillaume; the sculptor of the finial figure of Nike and the historical and
                    allegorical bronzes was Louis-Léon Cugnot.</p>
